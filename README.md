# MyTeamIO

## Description

What was my motivation?

- I was motivated to learn how to take models and output a file that displays multiple outputs from the same model.

Why did I build this project?

- The project was built around taking inquirer and having the user respond and then generate a website that displays multiple employees in cards.

What problem does it solve?

- It solves the problem of not needing to hardcode data and instead have a model that can have data sent to it over and over again and output a desirable product.

What did I learn?

- I learned how to use .filter and .map to take in the data from the user to make sure it sends the correct data to the cards. This way it multiple of the same type of card (like Intern) can be created without overwriting itself.
